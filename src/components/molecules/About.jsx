                I'm an enthusiastic, self-described designer with a focus on
                front-end development. Bringing the technical and aesthetic
                elements of digital things to life excites me greatly. I care
                about developing readable, clean, and incredibly performant
                code, as well as user experience and pixel-perfect design.

                I started my career as a web developer in 2023, and ever since
                then, I've developed further, taking on new tasks and picking up
                the newest technology. Two years after I began my web
                development career, I am now in my early twenties and creating
                state-of-the-art web applications with the help of contemporary
                technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, Tailwindcss, Git, and
                more.

                I am a very forward-thinking person who likes to work on
                projects from conception to completion.

                I like to work on items from conception to development because I
